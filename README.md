# Readme
This is the codebase for my personal portfolio [www.jeremycarlsten.com](https://www.jeremycarlsten.com). The code here is licenced under the MIT license so feel free to clone it down and make it your own, just please don't use my headshot that would be... wierd.
I would also guess that you haven't worked the same places as me so you might want to change that aswell.
